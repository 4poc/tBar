1. Installation

	Normal installation:
	- Install Tcl/Tk 8.5 or higher, libtk-img, tcllib and libsqlite3-tcl
	- Run: make install (or: make DESTFILE=mydir install)
	- Modify /etc/tbar/config.tcl to fit your needs or create ~/.tbar/ and copy /etc/tbar/config.tcl there, to have a user specific config
	- Run: tbar

	- To uninstall run: make uninstall, make sure to specify DESTFILE if you have done so in the install

	Starkit:
	- Unpack the archive and run: make install (or: make DESTFILE=mydir install)
	- Modify /etc/tbar/config.tcl to fit your needs or create ~/.tbar/ and copy /etc/tbar/config.tcl there, to have a user specific config
	- Run: tbar
	
	- To uninstall run: make uninstall, make sure to specify DESTFILE if you have done so in the install

2. User specific widgets and libraries

	From version 1.2 onwards, users are able to integrate custom libraries and widgets using folders located in their userland.
	Place custom libraries (along with a pkgIndex.tcl file) in ~/.tbar/lib, in order to make the libraries accessible to tbar. You will
	have to create the folder manually, if it exists, it will be automatically appended to tcl's auto_path of the interpreter tbar is
	running in.
	
	If you wish to install custom widgets on a per user basis (for your user only), create ~/.tbar/widget and copy the widget wrapper
	files to be loaded there. The widget wrapper file must be named after the widget, e.g. widgetname foobar would imply foobar.tcl
	as widget wrapper file name.

3. Widget notes

	This section contains special notes on modules:

	i3_workspace.tcl:
		This module requires the library from http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcl-unixsockets/. Unfortunatly, the source was not
		compilable at the time this note was written, which is why you will need to obtain the patched source from:
		http://siyb.mount.at/tbar/releases/unixsocket_tbar_0.1.tar.gz.

		autoconf -> ./configure -> make -> make install
